Are you interested in learning more about the metadata stored in your digital photographs? Do you want to view the various camera settings used to capture an image, such as the aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and focal length? Look no further than EXIF Reader! This Python script provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface that allows you to select one or more image files, view their EXIF data, and preview the selected image(s).

## Introduction

This tool is capable of extracting and displaying EXIF data from a variety of file types such as JPEG, PNG, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, BMP, WEBP, CR2, NEF, ORF, SR2, SRW, DNG, RW2, RAF, PEF, and ARW. It allows you to preview the selected image(s) and view their metadata tags. With the help of geopy, you can even search and locate GPS coordinates on Google Maps. Plus, I've got some exciting news: I've added a new feature to the app that lets you remove all the EXIF data from your photos with just one click!

## Installation

Before running this tool, you need to install the following packages:

-   tkinter
-   PIL
-   exifread
-   geopy
-   GPSPhoto

You can install these packages by running the following command:

```python
pip install tkinter Pillow exifread geopy GPSPhoto
``` 

## Usage

To run the program, simply run the `EXIF_Reader.py` file using Python.

You can add files individually or add a whole folder by clicking on the respective buttons. Once files are added, you can select any of them to preview the image and display its metadata. You can search for GPS coordinates in the metadata and click the button to locate them on Google Maps. And now with our new feature, you can remove all the EXIF data from your photos with just one click!
